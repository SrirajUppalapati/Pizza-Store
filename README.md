# FAST REACT PIZZA CO.

Welcome to Pizza Store, a user-friendly application designed to simplify your pizza ordering experience.

## How It Works

Orders are made by sending a POST request with the order data (user data + selected pizzas) to the API. The API responds with a unique order ID which is then displayed to the user.

## Features

- **No Account Required:** Simply input your name and start ordering. No need to remember another password!
- **Dynamic Menu:** Our pizza menu is loaded from an API, ensuring you always have the latest options.
- **Easy Ordering:** Add multiple pizzas to your cart and place your order with just your name, phone number, and address. Optionally provide your GPS location for easier delivery.
- **Priority Orders:** Mark your order as "priority" for an additional 20% of the cart price for faster delivery.
- **Post-Order Modifications:** Change your order details even after placing it.
- **Payment on Delivery:** No credit card information required. Pay when your pizza arrives.
- **Unique Order ID:** Every order receives a unique ID for easy tracking.
